%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
%\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{ae,aecompl}

%%%%% AUTHORS - PLACE YOUR OWN PACKAGES HERE %%%%%

%\usepackage{morefloats}% A pacakge which enables this text to contain more figures and tables.
\usepackage{grffile}% A pacakge which changes the algorithm to check for known extensions, so that we can insert pdf figures into this text.

% Only include extra packages if you really need them. Common packages are:
\usepackage{graphicx}	% Including figure files
\usepackage{amsmath}	% Advanced maths commands
\usepackage{amssymb}	% Extra maths symbols
\usepackage[position=top]{subfig}
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage{comment}

%%%%% AUTHORS - PLACE YOUR OWN COMMANDS HERE %%%%%

% Please keep new commands to a minimum, and use \newcommand not \def to avoid
% overwriting existing commands. Example:
%\newcommand{\pcm}{\,cm$^{-2}$}	% per cm-squared
\newcommand\HII{{H\,\textsc{ii}}} % ionized hydrogen
\usepackage{etoolbox}
\makeatletter % Workaround to only color the year for cite commands
  % Patch case where name and year are separated by aysep
  \patchcmd{\NAT@citex}
    {\@citea\NAT@hyper@{%
      \NAT@nmfmt{\NAT@nm}%
      \hyper@natlinkbreak{\NAT@aysep\NAT@spacechar}{\@citeb\@extra@b@citeb}%
      \NAT@date}}
    {\@citea\NAT@nmfmt{\NAT@nm}%
    \NAT@aysep\NAT@spacechar\NAT@hyper@{\NAT@date}}{}{}

  % Patch case where name and year are separated by opening bracket
  \patchcmd{\NAT@citex}
    {\@citea\NAT@hyper@{%
      \NAT@nmfmt{\NAT@nm}%
      \hyper@natlinkbreak{\NAT@spacechar\NAT@@open\if*#1*\else#1\NAT@spacechar\fi}%
        {\@citeb\@extra@b@citeb}%
      \NAT@date}}
